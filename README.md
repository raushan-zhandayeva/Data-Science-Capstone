IBM Data Science - Applied Capstone 

This capstone project represents the culmination of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. It demonstrates the application of the key concepts and skills acquired throughout the program.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. The goal of this project is to determine the likelihood of the first stage of the rocket landing successfully. This information is crucial for determining the cost of a launch, and it can be valuable for other companies, such as Space Y, that aim to compete with SpaceX in the rocket launch market.
